## \[ Hi guys\! Who need the form\-icon in taskbar with 'BorderStyle=0\!' \]


</div>

### Description



This code is for those guys who wish to make their forms unique/attractive by creating theirown skins or background images. But the problem is that when you set the form-'BorderStyle=0', the form-icon will not be there in the taskbar. Because, a 'ZeroBorderStyle' will not support icons in taskbar. This code contains a 'SetZeroBorder' function which can set your form without a border and the icon is there in the taskbar. This is a very simple implementation and works perfectly. Enjoy! and please leave your valid comments.
